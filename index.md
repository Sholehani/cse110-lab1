Hi! My nickname is Shol. I'm a Computer Science major here at UCSD looking for meaningful ways to develop my network and technical skills. My main goal in this field surrounds  developing projects that serves undereprentated conflicts/communities and that advocates for accessibility. Hobbies of mine include ice skating, video games, and hanging out with freinds and family. I look forward to the challenges this course has to offer.
